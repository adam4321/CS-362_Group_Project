# CS-362 Group 7 Project for Winter 2020

This is a two part project to practice using Test Driven Development. First a test plan is created by the group and then a test suite is built. In part two, a limited functionality command line calculator is built to pass the test suite.

The UnitTestOnly file contains the unit test file and then the function declarations to allow the program to compile.

The UnitTestAndCode file contains the final implementation of the calculator.
